\section{Conclusion and Related Work} % (fold)
\label{sec:related}
In this work, we propose an approach to improve loop invariant generation through guess-and-check. In particular, we propose to apply active learning techniques so as to learn accurate candidate loop invariants prior to the invariant checking phase. Furthermore, we propose a path-sensitive way of learning disjunctive loop invariants through classification. In principle, our approach can be extended to learn arbitrary mathematical classifiers using methods like SVM with kernel methods~\cite{svm:kernel}.
Nonetheless, %due to the limited verification capability of existing program verification techniques,
we focus on invariants in the form of polynomial inequalities or conjunctions/disjunctions of polynomial inequalities in our evaluation.
%Furthermore, we assume there is a bound $k$ on the number of clauses in the variant.
%In practice, we would expect (refer to empirical evidence in Section~\ref{sec:evaluations}) often $k$ is of a small value.
