\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}


\paragraph{Limitation and Potential Remedies}
We remark that in theory, we could learn non-linear classifier using methods like SVM with kernel methods~\cite{}. Nonetheless, due to the limitation of proving capability and tools with regards to non-linear constraints, we leave those to our future work. Furthermore, we assume there is a bound $k$ on the number of clauses in the variant. In practice, we would expect (refer to empirical evidence in Section~\ref{evaluation}) often $k$ is of a small value.
